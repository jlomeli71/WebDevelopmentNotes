# Web Development practice repository

This repository is for storing notes on my Web Development learning experience, I been taking notes and doins several excercises.

Currently my role is in networking and network automation, I do not plan to change my career to Web development, righ now is just a hobbie that I plan to add as a skill and apply this on my job project documentation.
